I picked the question about whether or not it's rude to speak to a stranger sitting next to you on a plane because I thought it was a funny question.
Personally, I don't love it when someone next to me is especially chatty, but it depends on the person. I was curious about what others think. 
The chart shows that most people don't think it is rude at all, which I found to be super interesting. Most people don't interact on planes and exist in their own little bubble. But maybe we should all be talking to each other more.
